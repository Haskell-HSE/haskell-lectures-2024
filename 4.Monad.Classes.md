# Monad classes

For now, consider the following monad transformers together with base Identity
monad:

```haskell
class MonadTrans t where
  lift :: m a -> t m a

newtype ReaderT e m a = ReaderT { runReaderT :: e -> m a }

instance Functor f => Functor (ReaderT e f)

instance Applicative f => Applicative (ReaderT e f)

instance Monad m => Monad (ReaderT e m)

instance MonadTrans (ReaderT e)

newtype WriterT w m a = WriterT { runWriterT :: m (w, a) }

instance Functor f => Functor (WriterT w f)

instance (Monoid w, Applicative f) => Applicative (WriterT w f)

instance (Monoid w, Monad m) => Monad (WriterT w m)

instance Monoid w => MonadTrans (WriterT w)

newtype Identity a = Identity { runIdentity :: a }

instance Functor Identity

instance Applicative Identity

instance Monad Identity

type MyMonad = ReaderT Int (WriterT String Identity)
```

Using transformers, we can compose several effects together, but if you try to
write a simple program with them, it will look like the following:

```haskell
myProgram :: MyMonad Int
myProgram = do
  env <- ReaderT (\env -> return env)
  lift (WriterT (return (show env, ())))
  return env
```

See how littered this is with different kinds of piping: `return`s, `lift`s,
monad constructors etc. Using some auxiliary functions, program becomes a lot
cleaner:

```haskell
ask0 :: Monad m => ReaderT e m e
ask0 = ReaderT return

write0 :: (Monoid w, Monad m) => w -> WriterT w m ()
write0 w = WriterT (return (w, ()))

myProgram' :: MyMonad Int
myProgram' = do
  env <- ask0
  lift $ write0 (show env)
  return env
```

```haskell
newtype MaybeT m a = MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) }

instance Functor f => Functor (MaybeT f)

instance Applicative f => Applicative (MaybeT f)

instance Monad f => Monad (MaybeT f)

instance MonadTrans MaybeT

type ExtMonad a = MaybeT MyMonad a

exit0 :: Monad m => MaybeT m a
exit0 = MaybeT (return Nothing)

divCtx :: Int -> ExtMonad Int
divCtx x = do
  y <- lift myProgram
  if y == 0 then exit0 else return (x `div` y)

divRed :: Int -> MaybeT (ReaderT Int Identity) Int
divRed x = do
  y <- lift ask0
  if y == 0 then exit0 else return (x `div` y)

-- use :: ExtMonad Int
-- use = divRed 5
```

```haskell
class Monad m => MonadWriterProto w m where
  writeProto :: (a, w) -> m a
  -- effectively same as w -> m ()
  unfoldWriteProto :: m a -> m (a, w) -- ??
  -- effectively same as m a -> m w

class Monad m => MonadReaderProto e m where
  readProto :: (e -> a) -> m a
  readProto f = fmap f askProto

  askProto :: m e
  unfold :: m a -> (e -> m a)

  localProto :: (e -> e) -> m a -> m a
  localProto f x = do
    e <- askProto
    unfold x (f e)
```

```haskell
class Monad m => MonadWriter w m where
  write :: w -> m ()

instance (Monad m, Monoid w) => MonadWriter w (WriterT w m) where
  write = write0

instance MonadWriter w m => MonadWriter w (ReaderT e m) where
  write = lift . write

instance MonadWriter w m => MonadWriter w (MaybeT m) where
  write = lift . write

class Monad m => MonadReader e m where
  ask :: m e
  local :: (e -> e) -> m a -> m a

instance MonadReader e ((->) e) where
  ask = id
  local f g e = g (f e)

instance Monad m => MonadReader e (ReaderT e m) where
  ask = ask0
  local f = undefined

class Monad m => MonadMaybe m where
  exit :: m a

instance MonadMaybe Maybe where
  exit = Nothing

instance Monad m => MonadMaybe (MaybeT m) where
  exit = exit0
```

```haskell
myProgram'' :: (MonadReader Int m, MonadWriter String m) => m Int
myProgram'' = do
  env <- ask
  write (show env)
  return env
```
