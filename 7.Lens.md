# Lenses and optics

```haskell
import Control.Monad.Trans.State (State, state, runState)
import Control.Monad.Identity (Identity (..))
```

Lenses! Profunctor optics! Some gibberish!

Say we have the following datatype:

```haskell
data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }

twan = Person { name = "Twan van Laarhoven", age = 39 }
```

Getting the name of a person is straightforward:

```haskell
twanName = name twan
```

Updating it is less so:

```haskell
twanInAYear = twan { age = age twan + 1 } -- ugly
```

With nested fields, this is even worse:

```haskell
data Paper = Paper { title :: String, author :: Person }

inAYear :: Paper -> Paper
inAYear paper = paper { author = (author paper) { age = age (author paper) + 1 } }
```

We could write setters and use them:

```haskell
setName :: String -> Person -> Person
setName name person = person { name = name }

setAge :: Int -> Person -> Person
setAge age person = person { age = age }

setAuthor :: Person -> Paper -> Paper
setAuthor author paper = paper { author = author }

twanInAYear' = setAge (age twan + 1) twan

inAYear' :: Paper -> Paper
inAYear' paper =
    let nowAuthor = author paper
     in setAuthor (setAge (age nowAuthor + 1) nowAuthor) paper
```

This is still cumbersome. What if we write a generic `update` function?

```haskell
update :: (a -> b) -> (b -> a -> a) -> (b -> b) -> (a -> a)
update get set f x = set (f (get x)) x

inAYear'' :: Paper -> Paper
inAYear'' = update author setAuthor (update age setAge (+ 1))
```

A lot better! It would be even better if we collected these functions together
in a single datatype:

```haskell
data Lens a b =
  Lens {
    get :: a -> b,
    set :: b -> a -> a,
    modify :: (b -> b) -> a -> a
  }

fromGetSet :: (a -> b) -> (b -> a -> a) -> Lens a b
fromGetSet = error "TODO"

fromGetModify :: (a -> b) -> ((b -> b) -> a -> a) -> Lens a b
fromGetModify = error "TODO"
```

```haskell
(&) :: Lens a b -> Lens b c -> Lens a c
l & l' = Lens {
    get = get l' . get l,
    set = \c a -> set l (set l' c (get l a)) a,
    modify = modify l . modify l'
  }

at :: Int -> Lens [a] a
at i = Lens { get = (!! i), set = error "TODO", modify = error "TODO" }
```

```haskell
type StateLens a b = forall k . State b k -> State a k

fromLens :: Lens a b -> StateLens a b
fromLens l s = state $ \a -> let (b, k) = runState s (get l a) in (set l b a, k)

toLens :: StateLens a b -> Lens a b
toLens f = Lens { get = \a -> error "TODO",
                  set = \b a -> error "TODO",
                  modify = \f a -> error "TODO"
                }

(&&) :: StateLens b c -> StateLens a b -> StateLens a c
l && l' = l' . l
```

```haskell
-- fmap :: (b -> c) -> (a, b) -> (a, c)
-- ^ polymorphic (strong) update
-- (b -> c) -> [b] -> [c]
-- get :: (a, b) -> b
-- get :: [b] -> ???
```

1. `fmap` as a datatype
2. get capability
3. `Lens` to be special case of such datatype

```haskell
type UnfoldedLens a b = forall k . (b -> (b, k)) -> a -> (a, k)

type PolyLens s t a b = forall k . (a -> (b, k)) -> s -> (t, k)

(&&&) :: PolyLens s t a b -> PolyLens u v s t -> PolyLens u v a b
l &&& l' = l' . l

mapped0 :: Functor f => PolyLens (f a) (f b) a b
mapped0 f fa = let x = fmap f fa in error "impossible"
```

```haskell
type Traversal s t a b = forall f . Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> (s -> f t)

mapped :: Traversable g => Traversal (g a) (g b) a b
mapped h ga = traverse h ga

type VLLens s t a b = forall f . Functor f => (a -> f b) -> (s -> f t)

setVL :: VLLens s t a b -> b -> s -> t
setVL l = modifyVL l . const

modifyVL :: VLLens s t a b -> (a -> b) -> s -> t
modifyVL l f = runIdentity . l (Identity . f)

newtype Const k a = Const { runConst :: k } deriving Functor

getVL :: VLLens s t a b -> s -> a
getVL l = runConst . l Const

lens :: (s -> a) -> (b -> s -> t) -> VLLens s t a b
lens get set f s = fmap (`set` s) (f (get s))
```

Above: lens

Below:

```haskell
data Prism a b = Prism { down :: a -> Maybe b, up :: b -> a }

toLensP :: Prism a b -> Lens a (Maybe b)
toLensP p = Lens { get = down p, set = \m a -> case m of { Nothing -> a, Just b -> up b }, modify = error "TODO" }

fromLens :: Lens a (Maybe b) -> Prism a b
fromLens l = Prism { down = get l, up b = set l b (error "Impossible") }
```

```haskell
type Optic p s t a b = p a b -> p s t

-- fmap :: Optic (->) (f a) (f b) a b
-- fold :: Monoid m => (a -> m) -> (f a -> m) = Optic (->) (f a) m a m
-- traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b) = ...

class Contravariant f where
  dimap :: (b -> a) -> f a -> f b

class Profunctor p where
  pmap :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> p b c -> p a d

type OLens = forall p . Profunctor p => Optic p

type OPrism = ...

type OIso = ...
```
