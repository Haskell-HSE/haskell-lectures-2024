# Laziness in Haskell

Haskell is a functional language based on typed lambda calculus where
everything is a well-typed expression, meaning it would allow you to do the
following:

```haskell
apply :: (Int -> Int) -> Int
apply f = f (apply f)
```

In most other languages, trying to evaluate this function on any argument would
lead to stack overflow. However, the following safely terminates in Haskell
(as it should):

```haskell
value = apply (\_ -> 5)
-- apply (\_ -> 5) = (\_ -> 5) (apply (\_ -> 5)) = 5
```

This is possible thanks to the special runtime system of Haskell, or RTS for
short. It computes values lazily rather than eagerly; this means that

```haskell ignore
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f b []       = b
foldr f b (x : xs) = f x (foldr f b xs)
-- foldr (:) [] [1..1000] = 1 : foldr (:) [] [2..1000] =
-- 1 : 2 : foldr (:) [] [3..1000]

foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl _ b []       = b
foldl f b (x : xs) = foldl f (f b x) xs
-- foldl (;) [] [1..1000] = foldl (;) (1 : []) [2..1000]
-- = foldl (;) (2 : 1 : []) [3..1000] = ...
```

```haskell
foldl' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl' _ b [] = b
foldl' f b (x : xs) =
    let b' = f b x
     in b' `seq` foldl' f b' xs

-- ($!)

foldl'' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl'' _ !b [] = b
foldl'' f !b (x : xs) = foldl'' f (f b x) xs
```

Strict fields in records

```haskell
data Point = Point {
  x :: !Integer,
  y :: ![Integer]
}
```
